# R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a free software. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zeland. It is widely used. 

"R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project and is similar to the S language and environment that was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and his colleagues. R can be considered as a distinct implementation of S, developed separately from the original implementation at Bell Laboratories. Although there are some important differences between these two implementations, much code written for S runs unaltered under R."
