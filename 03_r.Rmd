# R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a free software. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zeland. It is widely used. 

"R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project and is similar to the S language and environment that was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and his colleagues. R can be considered as a distinct implementation of S, developed separately from the original implementation at Bell Laboratories. Although there are some important differences between these two implementations, much code written for S runs unaltered under R."

**Advantages:**

1. R is free and open
2. R is extensible and programmable
3. R has thousends of high quality packages

**Disadvantages:**

1. ~~R is free and open~~ -> R is an investment
2. ~~R is extensible and programmable~~ -> R needs to be programmed
3. ~~R has thousends of high quality packages~~ -> R has too many packages

### R vs Bioconductor:
- R is a general-purpose programing language for statistical computing and visualization.

- Bioconductor uses R data structures, methodes and packages for bioinformatics.

- R is a decentralized, open-source project.

- Bioconductor is lead by a Core Team of full-time developes.

- R provides methodes primarily acting on generic data structures like numeric, matrix, data.frame, and 'tidyverse' alternatives like tibble.

- Bioconductor provides methodes primarily acting on integrative data structure for -omics, like GRanges and SummarizedExperiment.

- R is enhanced by the CRAN ecosystem of > 10K add-packages spannning all areas of science, economics, computing, etc..

- Bioconductor: an ecosystem of > 1.200 add-on packages.

- R: CRAN enforces basic package requirements of man pages, and clean machine checks.

- Bioconductor enforces additional packages requirements of vignettes, re-use of core Bioconductor data structures, unit tests.

- Bioconductor development is supported by several EC and NIH grants.
