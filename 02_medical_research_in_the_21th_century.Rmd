### Historicly: 
couple of experimental datapoints, small literature

## High-throughput technologies in biology
- include a diagram of pubmed publication increase over time
- different statistic neede to the new technologies 
- nice image needed: how changed the data volume from pcr to pcr-array to microarray to mRNA-seq to scRNA-seq
- central dogma: steps and omics


## Introduction to some moder technologies:

### 1. PCR and PCR-array
- link to a nice, high impact paper from the recent couple of years:
